		<h1>Important for {{name}}, help with your code violations</h1>
		<p>Hello {{name}},</p>
		<p>
			I understand that you may have received a notice of code violations on one
			of your properties,
			{{address1}},
			{{city}},
			{{state}},
			{{zip}}. I'm here to offer my assistance. As a real estate investor, I
			specialize in helping property owners in difficult situations like yours.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're looking to sell the property with code violations, I would be
			interested in making a free, no obligation cash offer for it. We buy
			properties AS IS, which means that you don't have to worry about making
			any repairs or renovations before selling.
		</p>
		<p>
			I understand that dealing with code violations can be a difficult and
			stressful process, and I want to make things as easy as possible for you.
			Our team will work quickly to put together a fair offer that meets your
			needs, and we can close the deal on your timeline.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're interested in learning more about our services and receiving a
			free cash offer for your property, please reply to this message. Our team
			is here to help and we look forward to working with you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sincerely,<br />
